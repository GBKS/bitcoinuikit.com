# bitcoinuikit.com

This repo holds the soure code for [bitcoinuikit.com](https://bitcoinuikit.com/), the website for the [Bitcoin UI Kit project](https://github.com/GBKS/bitcoin-wallet-ui-kit) by the [Bitcoin Design Community](https://bitcoin.design/).

It's currently hosted under my Github profile, but should be moved to the Bitcoin Design Github organization once it's not so rough.

## Local development

It's possible to use just npm, I prefer using [Vue UI](https://cli.vuejs.org), as it provides a visual interface for local development.

Use node 16.13.0

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
